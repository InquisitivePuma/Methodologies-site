  <P>The waterfall methodology consists of six stages:<img src="waterfall-beauty-lets-explore-lets-get-lost.jpg" align="right"/></P>
  <P>Determining requirements, Analysis, Design, Coding,</P>
  <P>Testing and maintainence.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>Determining requirements involves market research, </P>
  <P>surveys, and speaking to clients in order to find </P>
  <P>out what exactly you need to develop. Then, you</P>
  <P>analyze - often using the TELOS (Technology, Econoics,</P>
  <P>Legal, Operative, timeScale) method - in order to determine</P>
  <P>the feasibility of the project. Next, design such as making</P>
  <P>flowcharts, heirarchy digrams and structure diagrams. Doing</P>
  <P>this allows the coding section to be organised properly.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>The coding section is where the product is actually </P>
  <P>produced. Documentation here could include comments in</P>
  <P>the code. After coding comes testing, and the fact that</P>
  <P>this doesn't come until so late in the project is a</P>
  <P>weakness of this methodology; flaws at thsi stage can send</P>
  <P>the project all the way back to the design stage! However, if</P>
  <P>the project makes it past this stage all that is left is </P>
  <P>maintainence; extending the project's life cycle by adapting </P>
  <P>it to changing enviroments by correcting, perfecting and adapting.</P>
