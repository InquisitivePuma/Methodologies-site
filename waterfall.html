  <P>The waterfall methodology consists of six stages:<img src="waterfall-beauty-lets-explore-lets-get-lost.jpg" align="right"/></P>
  <P>Determining requirements, Analysis, Design, Coding,<br>
  Testing and maintainence.<br>
  <P></P>
  <P>Determining requirements involves market research, <br>
  surveys, and speaking to clients in order to find <br>
  out what exactly you need to develop. Then, you<br>
  analyze - often using the TELOS (Technology, Econoics,<br>
  Legal, Operative, timeScale) method - in order to determine<br>
  the feasibility of the project. Next, design such as making<br>
  flowcharts, heirarchy digrams and structure diagrams. Doing<br>
  this allows the coding section to be organised properly.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>The coding section is where the product is actually <br>
  produced. Documentation here could include comments in<br>
  the code. After coding comes testing, and the fact that<br>
  this doesn't come until so late in the project is a<br>
  weakness of this methodology; flaws at thsi stage can send<br>
  the project all the way back to the design stage! However, if<br>
  the project makes it past this stage all that is left is <br>
  maintainence; extending the project's life cycle by adapting <br>
  it to changing enviroments by correcting, perfecting and adapting.</P>
